      <h3>Is Covid-19 bringing Boris Johnson's and the Conservative's tenure to an end?</h3></div>
    <div class="d">
      <p>Project Aims: Covid-19 is the greatest problem any government has had to face since the 2nd World War. The task of dealing with this unprecedented national emergency
          has fallen to Boris Johnson and his Conservative government. His government would suggest they have handled the pandemic well, without their power being undermined. 
          This project aims to test this and answer: How effected has Boris Johnson's grip on power been effected by the pandemic and which area of the pandemic has effected it 
          the most? The following graphs will try to illustrate this.</p>
  <div>  
  <div class="chart" id="chart19">
      <script>
        var myChart19 = "project%20json/pmtracker.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart19', myChart19);

  <div class="d">
    <p>The graphs above and below illustrate the support the British public have for the government. As we can see since roughly summer this year, polling in favour 
        of Boris Johnson and the Conservatives has gone rapidly downhill. Why is this?</p>
  <div>
  <div class="chart" id="chart20">
     <script>
       var myChart20 = "project%20json/votingintention.json";
       vegaEmbed('#chart20', myChart20);
      </script>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>  
    
  <!--Chart 3 -->
  <div class="d">
    <p>First, using the graphs below we explore if the rising deaths caused by Covid-19 have caused this drop in support for the Government. As shown in the graph below
        there have been significant numbers of deaths with a peak being reached on January 20th 2021 with 1800 deaths.</p>
  <div>
  <div class="chart" id="chart21">
    <script>
        var myChart21 = "project%20json/deaths.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart21', myChart21);
      </script>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>  
    
  <!--Chart 4 -->
  <div class="d">
    <p>To explore whether deaths were linked to this drop in Government approval I used a regression where an R squared value of 0.01 was calculated. This shows that
        deaths have little causation in the drop in Government approval. What else then could be linked to this drop?</p>
  <div>
  <div class="chart" id="chart22">
     <script>
         var myChart22 = "project%20json/deathsregression.json";
         vegaEmbed('#chart22', myChart22);
      </script>
      </div>
    </div> 
    </div>  
    
 <!--Chart 5 -->
 <div class="d">
   <p>In the graph below I regressed Covid cases against Government approval instead, which produced a much higher R squared value of 0.73. This illustrates that
       there is a significant link between the Government's approval rating and the number of Covid-19 cases in the country.</p>
 <div>
 <div class="chart" id="chart23">
     <script>
         var myChart23 = "project%20json/govregression.json";
         vegaEmbed('#chart23', myChart23);
     </script>
     </div>
    </div>
    </div> 
 
 <!--Chart 6 -->
 <div class="d">
   <p>Leading on from this finding about the link between Government approval and Covid-19 cases, I compared deaths, cases and vaccinations on the graph below to 
       see if the link was made any clearer. We can see again that the darker the circle, the higher up the approval rating is, whilst there appears to be no 
       link between vaccination numbers and deaths to approval.</p>
 <div>
 <div class="chart" id="chart24">
     <script>
         var myChart24 = "project%20json/vaccinations.json";
         vegaEmbed('#chart24', myChart24);
     </script>
     </div>
    </div>
    </div> 
    
 <!--Chart 7 -->
 <div class="d">
    <p>As a result, in answering my question, it appears that Covid-19 and Boris Johnson's tenure hinge 
       on whether he is able to get cases under control. With greater numbers of cases comes lower approval ratings which could potentially harm his grip on power
       as I have shown. This is why vaccinations are so important, with the last chart showing the rapid hand out of them, as with greater vaccinations comes smaller
       case numbers which corresponds to larger approval ratings and a strong grip on power for Boris Johnson. To this end, vaccine numbers would also be a 
     strong indicator of approval, yet this has been undermined recently by the new Omnicron variant where large vaccine numbers have still lead to large case
     numbers. Here, we can see that Covid-19 is an ever changing problem which may lead to further surprises along the way that could affect the governments
        position</p>
